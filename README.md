<h1>SHPE Directory Builder</h1>

Every year, the SHPE-GSFV chapter begins it's new Fiscal Year and we need to be able to have a fast way of creating a new folder structure in order for us to keep track of our files in an efficient manner.  This tool takes the burden of having to manually create the folders.

<h2>Installation</h2>

run java -jar SHPEDirectory.jar 

the jar will run and create the files on your desktop.
